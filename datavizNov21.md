The goal of this section is to address some issues related to data visualisation for scientific communication and outreach.
This section is written for every person who might be interested in data visualisation, regardless of their academic field and background expertise. It aims at showing how effective data visualisation can be created with simple and accessible tools. 
# editorial choices
there is no clear cut rule on what you should/should not include in your charts. However, a good rule of thumb is to make editorial decisions beforehand; for example:
- what is your goal? e.g. informing/persuading
- what is your audience? is it knowledgeable?
- how will the visualisation be experienced, can people take their time to understand it in detail or does it have to be more immediate?
- what is the medium, will the figure be printed out, or visualised online?
# data accessibility
keep in mind cognitive and perceptual constraints that might affect the data experience

# multidisciplinarity
different skills and backgrounds
